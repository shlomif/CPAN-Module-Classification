Pattern: Recommendations/Related Items:
=======================================

Examples for this:

* In Amazon.com:
- http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/0385267746

"Customers who bought this book also bought".

* In Freshmeat.net:
- http://freshmeat.net/projects/perl/

"Users who subscribed to this project also subscribed to:"
"Projects depending on this project"
"Other projects from the same categories"

Pattern: Search Bar:
====================

* when most people look for information, they just use the search:  
    - using the front page (Search is available everywhere).
    - using a browser search bar.
    - using a shortcut on the desktop/browser.

* People believe they can type what they want (and get there)
faster than a guide or web-directory or whatever can yield them.

Pattern: related sites:
=======================

* When searching for something in Google one can also go to an image search,
etc.

- http://www.google.com/search?q=firefox&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8
  <->
- http://images.google.com/images?q=firefox&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&um=1&sa=N&tab=wi

* Perhaps it would be a good idea to cross link the search for
perldoc.perl.org, kobesearch.cpan.org, perl.com, perlmonks.org etc.
